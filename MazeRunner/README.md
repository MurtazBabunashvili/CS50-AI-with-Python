# ðŸ§© MazeRunner â€” Python Maze Solver with GUI

**MazeRunner** is a maze-solving visualization project written in Python.  
It uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms to find a path from start `A` to goal `B` in a text-based maze file â€” then visualizes the solution using a simple **Tkinter GUI**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ§± **Reads maze layouts** from a `.txt` file (walls = `#`, start = `A`, goal = `B`, paths = spaces)
- ðŸ§  Implements both **DFS** and **BFS** search algorithms  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Tkinter GUI visualization** with clear colors and scaling  
- ðŸ’¡ Easy to extend and modify for animations or new algorithms
